# observer-hive: client frontend

This module is the client side server process of the observer-hive. It allows you to process events received
from webservices such as Gitlab, Jenkins and Sonarqube. If you are interested in the full project you should
take a look at its counterpart: the [conductor server](https://iteragit.iteratec.de/observer-hive/scab-oberserver-hive).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This application is meant to run on a RaspberryPi. What should be installed:

* [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) - the operating system on the RaspberryPi
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org) - usually comes with Raspbian

### Installing

#### Debian package

If you have downloaded the Debian package simply run

```
sudo dpkg -i client-frontend.deb
```

If this fails due to missing dependencies run

```
sudo apt-get -f install
```

You should now be good and ready.

## Running the tests

`pytest` has been setup as the test runner of this package. You can run the tests with the following command:

```
python3 setup.py test
```

## Documentation

The docs of the modules have been generated by `Sphinx`. In the docs > _build > html directory you will find the
`index.html` which is the main page of the documentation. If you make changes to the docs and want to re-generate
the html files then run from within the docs folder:

```
make clean
make html
```

For more information on `Sphinx` see [its official documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
