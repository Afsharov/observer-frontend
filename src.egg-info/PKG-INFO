Description: # observer-hive: client frontend
        
        This module is the client side server process of the observer-hive. It allows you to process events received
        from webservices such as Gitlab, Jenkins and Sonarqube. If you are interested in the full project you should
        take a look at its counterpart: the [conductor server](https://iteragit.iteratec.de/observer-hive/scab-oberserver-hive).
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        This application is meant to run on a RaspberryPi. What should be installed:
        
        * [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) - the operating system on the RaspberryPi
        * [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org) - usually comes with Raspbian
        * [pip]() - package management system which comes with the newer versions of Python
        
        ### Installing
        
        ### With pip
        
        We recommend creating a virtual environment with `virtualenv` to run the app. If have never used a 
        virtual environment or seek a little insight on why to use it have a look at this short 
        [tutorial](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/how-to-use-python-virtualenv/).
        Once you have the package on your computer you simply install the package by using `pip` :
        
        ```
        pip3 install .
        ```
        
        Of course, depending on your system and version of `Python` you might have to substitute the command 
        `pip3` for `pip`.
        
        #### Debian package
        
        With the `Debian` package you can not only install the package but easily deploy the project. 
        If you have downloaded the package simply run
        
        ```
        sudo dpkg -i client-frontend.deb
        ```
        
        If this fails due to missing dependencies run
        
        ```
        sudo apt-get -f install
        ```
        
        You should now be good and ready.
        
        ## Running the tests
        
        `pytest` has been setup as the test runner of this package. You can run the tests with the following command:
        
        ```
        python3 setup.py test
        ```
        
        ## Deployment
        
        We have written an extensive manual on the scab-observer-hive project where you can find instructions
        on how to [deploy the client server on your RaspberryPi](). 
        
        ## Documentation
        
        The docs of the modules have been generated by `Sphinx`. In the docs > _build > html directory you will find the
        `index.html` which is the main page of the documentation. If you make changes to the docs and want to re-generate
        the html files then run from within the docs folder:
        
        ```
        make clean
        make html
        ```
        
        For more information on `Sphinx` and how to expand the docs see 
        [its official documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
        
        ## Built With
        
        * [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - lightweight WSGI web application framework
        
        ## Versioning
        
        We use [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://iteragit.iteratec.de/observer-hive/client-frontend.git).
